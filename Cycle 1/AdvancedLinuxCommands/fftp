FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a standard network protocol used to transfer files to and from a remote network.
To open an ftp connection to a remote system use the ftp command followed by the remote server IP address or domain name
cd - change directory on the remote machine.
mget - copy multiple files from the remote to the local machine.
Once you are done uploading files to your remote FTP server close the connection with bye or quit.
