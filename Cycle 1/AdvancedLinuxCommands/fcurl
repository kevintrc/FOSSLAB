curl is a command line tool to transfer data to or from a server, using any of the supported protocols (HTTP, FTP, IMAP, POP3, SCP, SFTP, SMTP, TFTP, TELNET, LDAP or FILE)
The most basic uses of curl is typing the command followed by the URL.
 curl can transfer multiple file at once
-o : saves the downloaded file on the local machine with the name provided in the parameters
-O : This option downloads the file and saves it with the same name as in the URL
-C – : This option resumes download which has been stopped due to some reason. This is useful when downloading large files and was interrupted
–limit-rate : This option limits the upper bound of the rate of data transfer and keeps it around the given value in bytes
-u : curl also provides options to download files from user authenticated FTP servers
-T : This option helps to upload a file to the FTP server
–libcurl :This option is very useful from a developers perspective. If this option is appended to any cURL command, it outputs the C source code that uses libcurl for the specified option. It is the code similar to the command line implementation
-x, –proxy : curl also lets us use a proxy to access the URL.
