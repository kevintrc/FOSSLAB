GNU wget is a free utility for non-interactive download of files from the Web
 It supports HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP protocols, as well as retrieval through HTTP proxies
wget can follow links in HTML and XHTML pages and create local versions of remote web sites, fully recreating the directory structure of the original site
Syntax : wget [option] [URL]
 -v / –version : This is used to display the version of the wget available on your system.
-o logfile : This option is used to direct all the messages generated by the system to the logfile specified by the option and when the process is completed all the messages thus generated are available in the log file. If no log file has been specified then the output messages are redirected to the default log file i.e. wget -log
-b / –background : This option is used to send a process to the background as soon as the process has started so that other processes can be carried out. If no output file is specified via the -o option, output is redirected to wget-log by default.
-a : This option is used to append the output messages to the current output log file without overwriting the file as in -o option the output log file is overwritten but by using this option the log of the previous command is saved and the current log is written after that of the previous ones.
 -i : This option is used to read URLs from file. If -i is specified as file, URLs are read from the standard input.If this function is used, no URLs need be present on the command line. If there are URLs both on the command line and in an input file, those on the command lines will be the first ones to be retrieved. The file need not be an HTML document if the URLs are just listed sequentially.
-c : This option is used to resume a partially downloaded file if the resume capability of the file is yes otherwise the downloading of the file cannot be resume if the resume capability of the given file is no or not specified. 
-r : this option is used to turn on the recursive retrieving of the link specified in case of fatal errors also. This option is a recursive call to the given link in the command line.
